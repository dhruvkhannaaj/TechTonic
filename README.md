# KisanSetu – Direct Agricultural Commerce & Logistics Platform

An integrated digital ecosystem empowering Indian farmers through transparent MSP-benchmarked crop pricing, intermediary-free commercial transactions, multilingual voice assistance, and end-to-end freight tracking.

---

## 1. Project Information

- **Project Title:** KisanSetu – National Agricultural Commerce & Logistics Platform
- **PS ID:** SIH26033
- **PS Title:** Direct Farmer-to-Consumer Market Linkage and Rural Logistics System
- **Category:** Software
- **Theme:** Smart Agriculture / Rural Development

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Indian agricultural producers frequently face distress selling due to information asymmetry, multiple layers of intermediaries taking significant commission cuts, and delayed payments at local mandis. Small and marginal farmers lack visibility into actual wholesale market demand, Government Minimum Support Price (MSP) spreads, and reliable rural transport networks to deliver harvests directly to bulk buyers and institutional consumers.

---

## 3. Proposed Solution

**KisanSetu** bridges the gap between cultivators, buyers, and rural logistics transporters:
1. **Direct Marketplace:** Eliminates commission middlemen, allowing farmers to list produce directly with transparent weight-based pricing.
2. **MSP Benchmarking & Negotiation:** Compares farmer quotes with official CACP MSP rates and local mandi price averages, enabling interactive multi-round price bargaining.
3. **Voice-First Accessibility:** Provides speech recognition in vernacular Indian languages (Hindi, Punjabi, English) so non-tech-savvy farmers can list harvests effortlessly.
4. **End-to-End Logistics Dispatch:** Connects regional drivers and freight operators with farm pickups, tracking waypoint status from harvest to delivery.
5. **Market Intelligence:** Offers real-time analytics on price realization indices, harvest arrival glut cycles, and state-level e-NAM trade statistics.

---

## 4. Key Features

- **Farmer Portal:** Produce cataloging, quality grade classification, harvest availability scheduling, and real-time earnings ledger.
- **Multilingual Voice Assistant:** Hands-free voice interface for adding listings and navigating features.
- **Wholesale & Retail Marketplace:** Crop filtering by commodity, harvest date, location, and verified farmer badges.
- **Counter-Offer Engine:** Bilateral transparent price negotiations between buyers and farmers.
- **Driver & Freight Module:** Route navigation, load assignment, OTP-based pickup validation, and delivery fulfillment.
- **Agricultural Market Intelligence:** Real-time visual comparison of Mandi vs MSP variances, price deficit alarms, and seasonal supply cycles.
- **Relational Data Layer:** Dual-engine database abstraction supporting plug-and-play SQLite and production MySQL databases.

---

## 5. Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Tailwind CSS, Lucide Icons, Chart.js
- **Voice Interface:** Web Speech Recognition & SpeechSynthesis APIs (Hindi / English / Vernacular)
- **Backend API:** Python 3.9+ HTTP Server & REST API Engine (`src/server.py`)
- **Database:** Relational Engine (Pre-seeded SQLite3 `src/kisansetu.db` with native MySQL `mysql_schema.sql` connector support)
- **Datasets:** Agmarknet, CACP MSP benchmarks, and e-NAM trade volumes (`data/`)
